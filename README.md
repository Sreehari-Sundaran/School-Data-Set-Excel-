**Problem Statement**<br>
You have the class wise marks of classes 1-10. This is a continuous dataset with marks ranging from 0 to 100. However, as understood marks can’t have outliers. For eg:- Marks can’t be <0 or >100, they can’t be blank, although 0 is acceptable.You are required to evaluate the performance of the class based on certain metrics. Use your prior understanding of excel to come up with solutions to the problem statements as below. Some of the basic excel functions like Sumif, Countif, Average, Formatting the data, Concatenate, Round, etc. will come
handy. Feel free to derive additional insights as well.<br>

<ins>**Problem Statements**</ins><br>
1.) Ensure the data has no blanks<br>
2.) Ensure the data has no outliers (Marks should vary between 0-100)<br>
3.) Sort the data by Student Name – Marks<br>
4.) Concatenate Name and Subject columns to create a KEY<br>
5.) Find the average marks of each class<br>
6.) Count the number of students in each class that got 100<br>
7.) Round the marks to nearest integer if not an integer<br>
8.) Do not use pivots to perform any of these operations so far<br>
